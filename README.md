## Colour and Font references

As part of the study, we searched for colors that evoke tranquility and relaxation. Our color palette was generated with different shades of blue, and we did contrast tests for coloTesting

pallet coloehttps://ibb.co/F0zmXQR</a>This was our first experience of as a group building our first full stack project within a month. This exercise aimed to apply all knowledge gained from the School of Code bootcamp, using our existing knowledge to experimenet something new, as well as learning and applying the following **skills**:

- Agile methodologies and tools
- Project planning & management
- UX/UI design processes
- Cooperation and decision making in a larger dev team

Having reflected on the project month as a team, we believe that our **strengths** included:

- Creating a strong team manifesto that helped us stay focused and keep momentum during decision-making phases.
- Creating an environment where all team members felt valued and could contribute.
- Designing a realistic and achievable MVP.
- Having daily stand-up and retrospect meetings to check in and plan next steps, keeping everyone on the same page.
- Every team member had the opportunity to be involved with each aspect of the project, resulting in an improved sense of understanding an ownership.

Thanks to these strengths, team morale remained high throughout the month and we were able to build a full-stack app that fulfilled our original brief and design.

**Lessons** to take forward to future projects:

- Although we wrote tests for the full project, testing should be given greater priority.
- Programming steps should be planned in great details but also be flexible at the same time.
- Constantly getting client feedback so that we can improve the app in development stage.
- Make sure our code is human-readable and organised.
- Always give the new technologies and framework a try.

## Testing

The Reconnect app has been tested on both the front and back end. The back-end has been tested using jest with various unit tests throughout the different routes. This ensures that the routes are intact and flags any issues that may pop up.
The front end of the app has been tested using cypress. The user journey is mapped out on the software as you travel through different pages and submit a mood for the mood tracker. This makes sure that the path we expect users to take will be robust and work the way in which it has been designed.
